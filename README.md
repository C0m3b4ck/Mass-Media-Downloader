# Why I made this
I wanted to back up and save all the games from Internet Archive, as I have too many empty disks lying around.

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.13)  
- Runs on Linux (tested on Ubuntu Linux) and Windows (untested, no linux-specific libraries though)
- Python libraries from requirements.txt 

## Installation  
<br>
<br>***On Linux:*** 
1. Make a Python 3.13 virtual environment
2. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run program .py

## How it Works 
Internet Archive script: uses the InternetArchive library to download from a specific collection into temp directory (same dir as script), then moves the finished files to right directory

## Instructions
Planning on making an instruction written in Markdown, both for users and for developers.

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements  
- support for other websites
- menu for choosing different scripts
- QoL fixes (will add more as I use the program more)
